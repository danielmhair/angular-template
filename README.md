# angular-template - A Lightweight Angular Template

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these
projects.

The seed contains a sample AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the Angular
framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.

The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire components together in Angular 1.5.x's way;
using a Component-based Architecture.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the angular-template repository and run:
```
npm install
```

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the angular-template repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-template. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone angular-template

Clone the angular-template repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/danielmhair/angular-template.git
cd angular-template
```

If you just want to start a new project without the angular-template commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/danielmhair/angular-template.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools for our Node server and Angular Framework code (libraries).  The tools help
us manage the application.

* We get the Node server tools via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

Currently, we only have you do 'npm install'. Normally, you would do 'bower install'
as well, but because Angular's NgComponentRouter is not supported in npm, so we had to
move that directory over to our lib folder. So for now, just do:

```
npm install
```

You should find that you have one new folder in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/lib` - Should you ever add new libraries via bower, you will see that package appear in this folder.

*Note that the `lib` folder would normally be found under a 'bower_components' folder installed in the root
folder but angular-template changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes
it easier to serve the files by a webserver.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

Keep in mind, there is a config.js file that has those presets to run the app at localhost:3000.
Should you need to change the port number, simply change it there.

## Testing

Soon to come: Unit tests and End to End tests.

## Updating Angular

Previously we recommended that you merge in changes to angular-template into your own fork of the project.
Now that the angular framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers (npm and
bower) you can use these tools instead to update the dependencies.

You can update the tool dependencies by running:

```
npm update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` file.

You can update the Angular dependencies by running:

```
bower update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `bower.json` file.
